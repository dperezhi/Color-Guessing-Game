# Color-Guessing-Game
This is a console-based game. Its original language is Spanish, but here are the instructions translated: 

1. The game generates a random code of 4 colors and assigns them to each of the secret positions on the board.
2. The player is given 10 attempts (one at a time) to guess which colors are in each of the 4 secret positions.
3. In each attempt, after the player selects the colors for each secret position, the program will provide information about whether the colors are correct and if they are in the correct position.
4. The player will only win if they guess the 4 colors in their correct places before the 10 available chances are used up. Otherwise, the player will have lost.

NOTE: When choosing the difficulty: 
* Easy - Colors do not repeat. (select 'F')
* Intermediate - Colors can repeat. (select 'I')
* Advanced - Colors can repeat and there is a possibility that one of the squares is empty. (select 'A')
